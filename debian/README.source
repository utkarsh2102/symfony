Changes to the upstream tarball provides by the authors of Symfony
==================================================================

Removed prebuilt windows binary
-------------------------------
The binary src/Symfony/Component/Console/Resources/bin/hiddeninput.exe has
been removed for the following reasons:
- Licensing of this file is unclear
- No source code is provided by upstream of Symfony
Additionally it is not needed under Debian at all.


Updating to a new upstream release
==================================
This packaging makes use of git-buildpackage.

Starting with 4.4, we are merging the signed upstream tags as
upstream, instead of using the tarball that doesnâ€™t ship tests.

# 0 Make sure upstream sure upstream's repository is added as a remote
git remote add upstream git://github.com/symfony/symfony

# 1 Fetch upstream's tags
git fetch upstream --tags

# 2 Example to import upstream 5.2.3 version
gbp import-orig --uscan --upstream-vcs-tag=v5.2.3

# 3 Make sure licensing is correct, especially for images.
#   There is script that might be helpful for the image licensing:
./debian/licensing/bin/check_image_licenses

# 4 ...and of course don't forget to update debian/changelog
